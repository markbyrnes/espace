# eSpace: A E-Commerce Project using React.js and Spring Boot

## Summary
Welcome to eSpace, the online marketplace for all your spacefaring needs! Whether its a brand new spaceship or a used one, whether its a warpdrive or a mining drone, eSpace has all your needs! Offering pickup and delivery.


## Why Did I Create This Project?
After creating SendIt—a social media website created using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a MySQL backend—I felt I had learned a good amount of web development. But after finishing it, I felt I had a few problems.

### Problem #1: I was using just basic HTML and CSS
In SendIt I relied a lot on just basic HTML and CSS knowledge, letting Bootstrap do a lot of the heavy lifting. This was because I felt overwhelmed just trying to grasp Flask and how backend development worked. But once I was done with the project, I realized that my front end skills needed more practice.

### Problem #2: I was relying too much on Python
After dealing with C++ for much of High School and then Java for the first couple years of college, I began to use Python much more in my junior and senior years. This has led to a lot of rustiness in my Java and C++ knowledge. So I figured why not shake off my Java rust and learn a new backend at the same time with this project's use of Spring Boot.

### Problem 3: I wasn't worrying about best practices
This is the final problem I realized. Firstly, I was not using git to its full potential, instead I was doing most of my version control locally. Secondly, I was not using automated testing in SendIt, ignoring unit tests and integration testing. This problem arised because I was unaware of the importance of git and testing until I was basically done with SendIt.  So realizing this, I wanted to create a new project with both of these in mind from the beginning.

### But Why a Space Themed E-Commerce Site?

I started out wanting to create an e-commerce site because I thought it would have an interesting frontend and backend, with the site having to handle items constantly being added and sold, having to sort items, add items to your cart, etc. 

The theme of a futuristic ebay was just because I found it cool, and interesting to know that one day in the future there probably will be some internet marketplace for people to buy spaceships, a website that the people of the future will find boring but we will find amazing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
